# Color Block Picker

This application displays a 4x4 grid of squares.  The colors are randomly assigned, and the application directs the user to click on a block of a particular color.  If the user clicks on the correct block, they will be informed of their choice, and an incorrect click will inform the user of the incorrect choice.  After each click, the colors are randomly reassigned.

This project is an assignment for Prime Digital Academy.  It is intended to practice using jQuery in applications.

## Features
- Color values and names are taken directly from an array in the app.js file
- Both the color name and value are used together to instruct the user of the correct color.
- Each click will update the score, tracking correct clicks out of total clicks
